# Project: Flex Panels Image Gallery

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* Use `console.table(x)` instead of `console.log(x)` to show table format in console
* `Array.prototype.filter`: Creates a new array by filtering entries that pass the the test (if this is true, then add to new array)
* `Array.prototype.map`: Creates a new array of the same length by taking each element of the array and performing a function to it. Ie, Create a new array that provides the full name by taking the first and last names and concatenating.
* `Array.prototype.sort`: Returns an array sorted by a specific element
* `Array.from(x)`: Create an array from a node list
* `Array.prototype.reduce`: Performs a reducer function on each item of the array.
